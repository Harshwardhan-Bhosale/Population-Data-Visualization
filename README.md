# Population-Data-Visualization
In this task, a bar chart was created to visualize the distribution of countries across different continents. The dataset was first loaded using Pandas, and the frequency of each continent was calculated using value counts. A bar chart was then plotted using Matplotlib to represent the distribution clearly.
